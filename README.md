# hello-world
This is my first time using Github. I look forward to learning more about it. 
I am a junior at NLU. I am a first-generation college student. I am majoring in business.
I am minoring in CSS and am looking to become an accountant after graduating from college. 
I have an older sister, a young brother, and two pet birds.
